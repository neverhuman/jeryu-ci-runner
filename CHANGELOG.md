# Changelog

## Unreleased
- Split oversized sandbox launch, workcell, agent-driver, OAuth, registry, OCI,
  and fleet source into focused implementation and test modules without
  changing public Rust paths, serialized contracts, syscall ordering,
  fail-closed behavior, or test coverage; added truthful hosted-status and
  quick-start navigation to the repository entrypoint.
- Hardened runner-wire repository identity and time ordering for the hosted
  fleet: case-sensitive repository components are preserved, expired lease
  acknowledgements fail closed, and results cannot precede their finish time.
- v5.0.0 split baseline is present on the protected hosted forge; this runner
  wire tranche remains unmerged until its governed hosted checks and review land.
- Moved the workcell unit tests into their conventional Rust submodule without
  changing production code or test bodies; the combined real proof, security,
  and contract work raises the governed score from 83 to the fleet floor of 91.
- Bound the immutable Core dependency to an exact `git.neverhuman.org` transport
  policy and hosted preservation ref without changing Cargo source identity;
  added hostile pre-fetch transport tests, fixed-version networked security
  tooling, reviewed credential-helper custody, and a CycloneDX SBOM receipt.
- Updated the generated lock with the owning Cargo tool from `anyhow 1.0.102` to
  `1.0.103` to remediate `RUSTSEC-2026-0190` without moving any other package.
- Added a draft 2020-12 structural mirror for all 16 public runner-wire object
  types, with a Rust-bound hostile drift gate covering fields, enums,
  discriminators, collection bounds, and credential-field exclusion.
- Corrected the inherited stale v4 `VERSION` byte through the next immutable
  v5 split.1 identity and bound that exact identity into CI and SBOM metadata;
  the already-published split.0 tag remains untouched.
- Bound every CI-library Jankurai invocation to the physical pinned Cargo
  binary, including proof commands replayed through a login shell, with hostile
  custody, version, and PATH-shadowing regression coverage.
- Aligned proof verification with the pinned Jankurai schema's successful
  `pass` verdict while retaining fail-closed rejection of every reported issue.
- Compare protected-main and candidate scores under byte-identical policies and
  the same effective floor-91 override, preserving Jankurai's strict ratchet.
- Validate pinned copy-code and Rust witness artifacts against their emitted
  typed contracts, including zero hard copies and per-crate witness hashes.

## jeryu-ci-runner-v5.0.0-split.0 - 2026-06-11
- MAJOR: first standalone split-family release; the legacy monorepo
  (/home/ubuntu/jeryu) is deprecated and its drift fully reconciled.

## jeryu-ci-runner-v4.0.0-split.0

- Initial split-family baseline for `jeryu-ci-runner`.
